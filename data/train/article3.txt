S President Donald Trump's son Eric has questioned Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris's ties to Indian Americans claiming that "she has totally run away from the community."

The attack comes as the election battle intensifies ahead of the November 3 election and the two parties are courting the Indian community with an eye on the swing states where a small margin of votes can determine the national outcome.


Speaking at the launch of Indian Voices for Trump in Atlanta on Tuesday, he attacked the Democratic Party as a "radical left" organisation that he said is against the values of Indian Americans and tried to link Harris to it, but the context of his assertion was muddled.

He said, "Much of this radical left is intolerant towards other people. In fact, sometimes I say that they are the least tolerant people in the entire world. You just look at Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris is of Indian descent and she has totally run away from the community ... The Indian community knows that. She is not going around saying that she is of Indian descent, in fact she is going around saying the exact opposite."

Harris is multi-ethnic of African descent on her father's side and Indian on her mother's.

She is variously described as African American, Indian American and Asian American and is the first non-White person to run for vice president on a major party ticket.


The dominant public ethnic identity of Harris has been African American, a powerful segment in the Democratic Party, but she has acknowledged her Indian identity.

In her speech at the Democratic Party Convention last month accepting the vice-presidential nomination, she spoke of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who she said came to the US from India and "raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage."
